BioX-CLPM version 0.0.1

+Mass spectrometry coupled with chemical crosslinking is an efficient
method to study protein - protein interactions.
+Mass spectra of cross-linked peptides contain m/z values of crosslinked
species as well as peptide fragments that are not cross-linked.
Thus, finding cross-linked species from this mass spectra is like
finding needles from hay-stack.
+Few programs have attempted to find cross-linked species from
mass spectra, but they are lacking few or more desired
functionalities.
+Newer version of CLPM is improvement over the previous one to
provide an all-inclusive tool to analyze mass spectra of all kinds of
cross-linked data.
+CLPM is an ongoing effort to include more and more functionalities
for analysis of chemical cross-linking data.
